# Why Köloñol App?

As a migrant, when I arrived in Germany, I was confronted with a different culture, a language I did not speak or understand. The difficulties were continuous, and I always had to ask for anything I needed. For this reason and after having lived the experience, I have decided to carry out a project that I have been dreaming about for years. Kolonol is the perfect tool for the newcomer from Latin America, in it you will find a variety of information, from how to make the Anmeldung, which and how to take out health insurance, get started in language exchange cirucles, access to offer of osseo in Spanish, such as parties, theater and a variety of Latin American gastronomic offer. Cologne has an enormous rate of Spanish-speaking migrants, many of them will be right now wondering how to do such and such, where to get that.
Kolonol is the tool that was missing to make the integration process more bearable.
